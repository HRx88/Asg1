Deliverable 2: Correct the selection of computer components which should show the user on what they can selected and not the component that user can’t selected.
Some motherboards only can put ddr5(ram) and can’t put ddr4(ram) or vice versa as you can see in the image below the motherboard only can put ddr5(ram) but the user got the option to select ddr4(ram) so it should remove the ddr4 option

Same problem here if you select intel/amd ryzen cpu you should only see the display those motherboards can be selected (intel motherboard for intel cpua and amd motherboard for amd cpu) and the image below can select both intel/amd motherboard.
